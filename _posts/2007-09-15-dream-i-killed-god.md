Yeah, that's hot.

I once asked a priest at my grandparent's anniversary parties if it was ok to idolize rock stars.

Emphatically, he said, “_No_“. I expected him to say that, so I wasn't shocked or anything. But I kept proding with the topic and said that I was aware of the whole ‘no idolizing false idols' thing and the yellow cow and all that but, “what if the guy's technique is amazing?”

“No,” he said, sternly, “you may not idolize rock stars just because their technique is amazing.”

“What if he plays the organs?” I semi-interrupted.

“Like, the big sounding ones in churches?” He asked me.

“Yeah. What if he sounds like that?”

“Would he play an actual organ or would he still use an electric guitar and make some kind of volume knob adjustment that makes it sound like a pipe organ?”

“The guitar one.”

He thought about it for a second.

“That's pretty fu-freaking cool, I guess. Yeah, that'd be ok, I think. God's not made of stone, you know.”

“Oh, I know.”

And I thought he was making up the whole volume knob technique shit but I had no idea that it was even <span style=“font-style: italic;“>possible. Jesus Christ.

For a stable, sane, productive member of society (all arguable, but let’s not complicate things), I’m far too mobile and unrooted. I travel quite a bit for a job that is simultaneously my greatest privilege and my worst burden.

So I write. And I write. Travel pieces, political journalism (a stretch from ranting but, still), short stories, poetry and other non-sense. I will keep going until something gives out, or someone gives in. Yeah.

But _who cares_? You’re not here for this self-glorifying crap; you’re here because you want to see the merchandise; _the stuff_. Ok, then. [Have at it](http://writtenrhetoric.com/stories/ "Written Rhetoric Stories").

Dylan is our political correspondent, bold and fiery as his fuse is short. He is a well-read, on-location kind of writer and is no stranger to travel. Intimately familiar with many distant and dark corners of the Earth, Dylan brings a new kind of blood to his vicious style of journalism. He sends his words, notes and effusive rants of observation, commentary and occasional judgement to be read [here](http://writtenrhetoric.com "Written Rhetoric Blog").
